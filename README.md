# CeltreSoftware's Preprocessor Library

Interface library with definitions for preprocessor options to support multiple compiler
decorations.

## How To Use

This is a header only library with only definitions, so you can simply download the code and include
the `include` directory, or download the package with your favorite manager, such as `vcpkg` or
CMake's `FetchContent` and, again, include the `include` directory.
